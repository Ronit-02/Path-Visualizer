# Path-Visualizer

This is a path visualizer tool that allows users to simulate various algorithms to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The currently supported algorithms are:

- Depth-first search (DFS)
- Breadth-first search (BFS)
- Breadth-first search using a queue (BFS-Queue)
- Dijkstra Algorithm 
- Users can select a starting node and an ending node, and the tool will show the path found by the selected algorithm.
